PROBLEM STATEMENT
Sensitive personal information like Aadhaar, PAN, phone number, email, and driving licence
number is often present inside digital documents.
When these documents are shared without redaction, it leads to privacy risks, identity theft,
and data misuse .
Many organizations share documents in large volumes, making manual redaction slow, 
tedious, and error -prone .
There is no simple automated system that can detect PII accurately across multiple file types 
like PDF , Word, images, and scanned documents.
Existing tools lack AI-based detection, policy -aware redaction, and support for Indian 
government ID formats .
Users and organizations need a fast, reliable, and automatic solution that can identify and 
hide sensitive information before sharing documents.

ABSTARCT
This project provides a secure mobile application that helps users protect sensitive personal 
information in documents before sharing them.
The user first unlocks the app using PIN or biometric authentication to ensure only authorised
access.
The user selects a document (PDF, Word, or image), and the system extracts text using OCR 
Tesseract or normal text reading.
The application automatically detects personal information like Aadhaar, PAN, phone numbers, 
emails, and driving licence numbers using regex and AI/ML based NER models .
A RAG based AI module analyzes privacy rules and decides which information should be masked or 
fully redacted .
The system then creates a clean, redacted version of the document that removes all sensitive data.
MySQL stores the redaction history and document activity securely.
The final output allows users to safely share documents without exposing personal information .

METHODOLOGY
User Authentication
User unlocks the app using PIN or biometric verification.
Document Selection
User selects a PDF, Word file, or image to process.
Text Extraction
OCR (Tesseract) and parsers extract text from the document.
PII Detection
Regex and NER models identify sensitive data (Aadhaar, PAN, phone, email, etc.).
RAG Decision
RAG model decides which information should be redacted or masked.
Redaction
System automatically hides or masks the detected PII.
Output
A secure, redacted document is returned to the user for preview or sharing.

ALGORITHM
OCR Algorithm
Input: Image or scanned PDF
Preprocess (grayscale, denoise, threshold)
Extract text using Tesseract OCR
Send extracted text to PII detection
PII Detection Algorithm
Regex:
Detect Aadhaar (4 -4-4), PAN (ABCDE1234F), phone, email
Store matched values + positions
NER (AI):
Identify PERSON, ID_NUMBER, EMAIL, ADDRESS, etc.
Combine Regex + NER resultsRAG -Based Redaction Decision
Input: PII list + document text
Retrieve policy rules from vector DB
LLM decides: REDACT / MASK / KEEP
Output: redaction plan for each PII
Redaction / Masking Algorithm
Locate each PII in the document
REDACT → replace with ████
MASK → partially hide (e.g., ******3210)
Generate final redacted document and return 
to user
